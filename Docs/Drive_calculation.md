# Mechanical Calaulation
Length of Rover $= 450mm$  
Suspension bar vertical travel $= 30 ^{\circ} = 450mm/2 * \cos(30) = 112.5mm \approx 100mm$  
Nominal vertical distance from suspension axis to wheel axis = wheel radius + offset from suspension arm + thickness of suspension arm + radius of bearing  
Bearing model for suspension axis tube = UCP201 (12mm bore, 60mm OD, Pillow block type ball bearing)  

Min Wheel Diameter = 100mm  
Max Wheel Diameter = 250mm  
Min Wheel Width = 60% of diameter (for higher manuverability)  
Max Wheel Width = 100% of diameter (for fough terrain)
